Using the Persian Font Fix Plugin
Once the plugin is installed, follow the steps below to fix Persian font rendering issues in your documents:

Step 1: Open a Document
Open a new or existing document in ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors.
If the document contains Persian text, you may notice that it is not displayed correctly or in the wrong font.
Step 2: Run the Persian Font Fix Plugin
In the open document, go to the Plugins menu from the top toolbar.
In the dropdown, select Persian Font Fix.
The plugin will automatically detect Persian characters in the document.
Step 3: Apply the Font Fix
Once the plugin detects the Persian text:

It will apply a compatible Persian font (e.g., "Vazir" or "IRANSans") to ensure that the Persian text is properly rendered.
You will see the text now displayed correctly with the appropriate font applied.
Step 4: Save the Document
